      <h2>Myself?</h2>
    <p>
        This is so strange.. My name is Amanda O'Bara.
        I am majoring in Computer Science at UB this semester.
        I went through high school as an art major and might
        return to that.. I am an ink and pastel artist. I also
        play the piano and violin.
